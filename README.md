# Kwitter React/Agile Project

Created by Diarte Jeffcoat, Cheria Artis, Howard Post and Chris McAfee

## Summary

This was our first ever big project during the Kenzie Academy curriculum. We used React, Redux and API manipulation in order to build a Twitter clone called Kwitter as our final project. In addition, we were to use Agile Methodology to ensure that we had a solid product to present in the end and be able to build a proper workflow representative of many companies in the real world.

## Overview

You will be working in teams to make a clone of a common micro-blogging platform. You will be given a back-end API for you to form your front-end application around. 
The API will include endpoints relating to authentication, users, messages, and likes. Your project must incorporate a majority of the endpoints given in the API.

A portion of your grade will be based on your team-working ability. Please see [this document](https://gitlab.com/kenzie-academy/se_public_files/team-guidelines/-/tree/master)
for guidelines.

You will also be following the Scrum process and, although everyone will be a developer and individual contributor, your team should account for the roles of Product Owner, 
Scrum Master, and QA Tester. Please see [this document](https://gitlab.com/kenzie-academy/se_public_files/scrum-guidelines/-/blob/master/README.md) for more details. 

Client memo:

_The logged in user's experience is the core of this application. So we want to establish this core experience first._
_Since this is a social application, we would like the application to emphasize engagement and engaging with other users as much as possible._
_We are also interested in establishing the look and feel of our visual brand early so that it can be reused throughout the rest of the application._
